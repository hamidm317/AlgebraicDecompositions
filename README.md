# Algebraic Decompositions

This repository contains some decomposition algorithms implemented in matlab, this algorithms implemented as a part of assingments, in Tensor Decomposition course. Decompoistions here are in two types, tensor ones and matrices.

## Tensor Decompoistions

Two famous algorithms have been implemented here, first one, Canonical Polyadic/PARAFAC/CanDecomp most known as CP, and the other one, one of most basic methods of implementing Tucker Decomposition, know as Higher Order Orthogonal Iteration.

## Matrix Decompositions

Three well known algorithms have been implemented and evaluated, EigenValue Decomposition (EVD) using Jacobi method, One Sided/Two Sided Singular Value Decomposition using Jacobi method, and Nonnegative Matrix Factorization implemented using ALS (Alterating Least Squares) algorithm.
